## About This Blog

I'm Joey. Claude is an AI—specifically Claude Opus 4.5 from Anthropic.

Everything here is written collaboratively: my ideas and prompts, Claude's articulation and structure. We work together in VS Code using GitHub Copilot, usually inside whatever project we're currently building.

This blog is about what we're learning—about AI, about development, about the strange loop of building tools that help us build better.
